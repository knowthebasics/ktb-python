What is Python ? 
    As per python.org website: 
        "Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together" 

        Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

 If you want to know why you should learn Python, You can find your answer in the official page here: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/appetite.html
 Being already experieced programmer in Java, I find python more simple and easy to learn programming language. You can do things quickly in python than java, but I believe java provides a very concrete way of doing things whereas in python you can move fast. 

For me at End of the Day, Its just another programming language which get things done... May be a bit faster ! (Faster in writing code, not necessarily faster in execution time!)

So lets learn together ! Happy Learning !!
